				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<p>I’m extremely interested in IT, as I believe it is a forever expanding industry, with tonnes of potential. My interest in IT started when I was very young. Our house had a shared home computer, and I would watch my sisters play games such as RuneScape, back in 2008-2009. My dad also used to repair and build new computers for people as a form of extra income, so I was always around the hardware side of IT. There was no particular event to spark my interest, but my dad is definitely the person who sparked my interest. He would always talk to me about the latest consoles or gadgets he would see, and it always amazed me the way he would talk about some of the things.</p>
