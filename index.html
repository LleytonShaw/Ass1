				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<p>I’m extremely interested in IT, as I believe it is a forever expanding industry, with tonnes of potential. My interest in IT started when I was very young. Our house had a shared home computer, and I would watch my sisters play games such as RuneScape, back in 2008-2009. My dad also used to repair and build new computers for people as a form of extra income, so I was always around the hardware side of IT. There was no particular event to spark my interest, but my dad is definitely the person who sparked my interest. He would always talk to me about the latest consoles or gadgets he would see, and it always amazed me the way he would talk about some of the things.</p>

			<h1>What these results mean to me</h1>
			<p>To me, these results show exactly how I am as a person. I enjoy being kind and helping people in need, while also enjoying deep and meaningful conversations. I believe that having good cooperation is extremely important, but I am able to improvise if need be. Additionally. I’m very open to learning and trying new things and extremely eager to improve. Additionally, I think these results would influence my behaviour in a team, as I am able to assess a situation and have a positive impact, regardless on if the team is working together on something new, or something that I am familiar with. Furthermore, I should form a team with someone who can take lead, as that isn’t something I’m very confident in. If I am able to do so, it will benefit the team and myself greatly as I can play my part confidently and efficiently.</p>

			<h2> Project Idea </h2>
			<h1> Overview </h1>
				<p>“Muse” is a social media music app hybrid that features high-quality music streaming and has the capability to display the number of minutes spent listening to individual songs, artists, or genres. Additionally, a pie chart displays the genres that you listen to the most, on your very own customisable profile! Furthermore, your profile will be displayed on leaderboards for the amount of time spent listening across all genres and in total, as well as, the capability to display in real time the music that you are currently listening to, as well as the capacity to add and communicate with friends who are also utilising the application.</p>

				<h1>Motivation</h1>
					<p>The motivation for this app is the immense amount of social presence end of year music wrapped has on social media. There are thousands of people every year posting their Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music wrapped online, showing off how many minutes of music they listen each year, how many minutes of specific genres and artists they listen to every year. Personally, throughout the year I have always wanted to know how many minutes I've listened to certain people for, and as someone who listens to music for 100,000+ minutes a year, being able to see this information would be satisfying to me, as well as many others, and Muse will be used to show such information, while offering many more features.</p>

				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p>“Muse” is a high-definition music streaming website and app that contains two key features: statistics monitoring and social elements. These features allow users to build connections through music. Muse will give the user the option to keep track of how much time they spend listening to specific songs, artists, and genres. If enabled, Muse can  also be a hub for competitions within the communities. There could be fun competitions, for example, users can compete with each other  from all over the world while listening to their  favourite songs and Muse can track on leader boards how often they listen to a song, an artist, genre, in all-time listening minutes. This will allow you to compare your listening habits with those of people from all over the world. Those who prefer high-end audio consumption will be able to benefit from the high-quality audio streaming that Muse will offer, which will reach up to 9,216 kbps sound quality (starting at 320kbps. Muse also tries to present its listeners with music recommendations that are based on the genres that are among their most frequently played. One example of this would be a playlist titled "top 10 pop songs," which would feature 10 pop songs that Muse believes the listener will love. Ideally, Muse strives to present up to 80 million songs from blues to reggae, all available at the click of a button. Muse will also have a monthly subscription to "Pro," which will allow users to listen to audio at the highest streaming quality, avoid commercials, and have free selection of any song they desire to utilise, to name just a few features. Muse Pro will cost the user $9.99USD per month for standard single person subscription, and $15.99USD per month for a "family" style subscription, allowing up to 6 members to use and enjoy all the features of Muse Pro. In addition to music, Muse will offer podcast streaming for users who like to listen to podcasts. The podcast streaming speed on the browser will be 128 kbit/s, while the podcast streaming speed on the app will begin at 96 kbit/s and can be lowered to 24 kbit/s in order to preserve data. Muse will have a social media function that allows users to create profiles, showcase their music interests and make new friends who have musical preferences that are similar to their own. Muse will have status update called “Stave”, where they can share an update of their day, a new favourite album or even just a lyric of a song they like. In addition, the profiles are customisable so that users can upload profile photos, banners and backgrounds. There will also be an event page so users can now when music festivals, concerts or live shows are nearby. Users can also follow musicians with verified accounts so that they can be the first to receive updates on new albums or tours.</p>

				<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
				<p>Python will be the primary language used in the development of Muse. This will ensure that it is compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS. In addition to that, we will make use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an easy to navigate user interface. It is necessary to have general hardware, such as a personal computer or a laptop, in order to create and produce the code.</p>
			</article>
			</section>
		<section>
			<article>
				<h1>Skills Required</h1>
				<p>Writing skills at an advanced level in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are going to be necessary in order to develop Muse. Python is one of the most common programming languages that are used today, so it shouldn't be difficult to locate someone who has the abilities that are required. Similarly, JavaScript is incredibly popular, particularly when it comes to the design of websites, which is something that will surely come in handy when developing Muse. Likewise, understanding HTML and CSS is not difficult to come by because both languages are utilised in the creation of millions of websites nowadays.</p>

				<h1>Outcome</h1>
				<p>If the "Muse" initiative is successful, it will have an extraordinarily positive impact on the world I.T as well as the world of music streaming. The entire world will have access to a brand-new method for listening to music in high definition, in addition to being able to communicate and share with friends, personalise their profiles, track the amount of time they spend listening to music, compete with people from all over the world, and stay up to date with the latest music releases and tour dates from their favourite artists!</p>
